The world has been focusing on stocks and crypto investments since it provides more returns to the capital we invest. The number of people trading on the stock market dramatically expanded, which resulted in the recent creation of numerous stock analysis applications. But a beginner or non-specialist who wants to trade on the stock market finds the current system confusing and overflowing with data. The main aim of this project is to develop a simple tool that provides a clear analysis about stocks through individual stock portfolios and provides financial expert support. The Financial Assistant application, Fin Assist, focuses on day-to-day financial data of the top hundred companies Listed in the London Stock Exchange, known as FTSE100. This web application creates stock portfolios, analyzes their trends in the historical data and helps the user to make decisions to invest accordingly. The methodology used here in this project is the quantitative data analysis of market trends and predict the near future value of the stock. A user can create personalized space by registering and creating a watchlist of favorite stocks to track their daily performance. Users who require extra help selecting the stocks can get professional advice. The well-designed user interface, admin, expert, and stock portfolio sections, share price graphs, and financial expert advice set this application standout in recent similar financial applications. A non-expert can easily comprehend the market trends due to classification of stocks by industries and sectors. The main challenges are the price fluctuations of the stocks caused by current economic conditions or recent events associated with the company.
