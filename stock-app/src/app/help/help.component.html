               <div class="sub-div">Open price: The open price is the result of opening an auction taking place before the start of the trading on a particular day. The opening price of a day is not the previous day’s closing price, as many order interests and valuations accumulate after the end of the trading day.  </div> 
       
               <div class="sub-div">Close Price: As every hour passes by, the Close price is the price of the stock at that hour. Also, it is the price of the last trade of a normal trading session in a day. </div>
                
               <div class="sub-div">High Price and Low Price: The High price is the highest price of stock during the day and low price is the lowest price of that day. </div>
        
        <div class="sub-div">Adj. Close Price: There are factors which affect the closing price after the market is closed. When the corporation or the company changes its stock splits, introduces new shares, or distributes its dividend, the closing price automatically changes.</div>
        
        <div class="sub-div">Volume: It is the cumulative volume of shares traded during the day. High volume or high entropy is a good measure of trading analysis. </div>
